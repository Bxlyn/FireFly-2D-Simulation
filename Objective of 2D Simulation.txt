Objective of 2D Simulation:
1. Add a background forest
3. Incorporate IRL speed conversion
5. Shows potential financial loss and money saved comparing with average financial loss in forest
6. End button that shows information about average detection speed, time elapsed, etc everything(linked to 5).


Issues:
- Repeated information in Log
- Detect doesn't show burned fire when detected, just before it was extinguished
- Might need better IRL conversions for the time and area. Area is too much
