In modern wildfire operations, the conventional baseline typically means:

Baseline = fires detected by humans / watchtowers / 911 calls / camera towers → usually very slow detection

Real data:

Region	Avg. detection delay	Typical spread rate	Notes
US Forest Service	15–45 minutes	10–50 m/min	Human reports or lookout towers
EU Forests	12–30 minutes	10–60 m/min	Mixed camera + human reports
Canada	30–60 minutes	20–100 m/min	Heavily forested areas
Australia	20–45 minutes	30–80 m/min	Strong winds

Global average detection delay: ~20–40 minutes

Our drone system detects fires within seconds(sim) → unfair to compare areas directly without using IRL spread rates.

So:

Baseline area (real-world conventional detection):
Abaseline m²=ROS (m/s)×delay (s)×360∘ growth footprint
A
baseline m²
	​

=ROS (m/s)×delay (s)×360∘
 growth footprint

Simplified (circle growth):

A=π⋅(r2)where r=(ROS×delay)
A=π⋅(r
2
)where r=(ROS×delay)

Real-world ROS (Rate of Spread):

Calm forest fire: 0.2–1.0 m/s

Moderate wind: 1–2 m/s

Dangerous: 2–3 m/s+

A good average for global forests:

→ ROS = 1.2 m/s
→ Detection delay = 20 min = 1200 seconds

Baseline radius:

r=1.2×1200=1440 m
r=1.2×1200=1440 m

Baseline area:

A=π⋅14402≈6.5 million m²=650 ha
A=π⋅1440
2
≈6.5 million m²=650 ha

This is why real fires become catastrophic before detection.

2. What does FireFly do?

Our simulation usually detects fires within:

0.5–4 seconds (sim)

At this IRL conversion, that’s:

≈ 10–60 minutes saved in real operations.

So FireFly final area is often:

50–3000 m², tiny compared to 6,500,000 m² baseline.


To calculate potential loss baseline is compared to the simulation of Firefly:


Baseline Area Calculation:
Area_baseline = π * (ROS * Delay)^2
Distance = 1.2 * 1200 = 1440 meters radius
Area = π * 1440^2 = ~6.5 million m² (~650 hectares)


Potential Loss in Sim:
actual_loss = (total burned area in simulation / 10,000 m² per hectare) 
              * cost_per_ha

cost_per_ha ≈ $11599 per hectare

Fire burns 4,000 m² = 0.4 ha
Loss = 0.4 × $12,000 = $4,800



Baseline Loss:
baseline_area = baseline_area_per_fire * number_of_incidents
baseline_loss = (baseline_area / 10,000) * cost_per_ha
Baseline area per fire = 650 hectares

Cost per hectare = $11,599

Baseline loss per fire ≈ $7.8 million.


Money Saved:
saved = baseline_loss – actual_loss

If: 
baseline_loss = €7.8M

actual_loss = €7,000

→ saved = €7,793,000
